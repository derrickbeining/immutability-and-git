# Welcome to FVS (Fullstack Version System
#### (...suggestions for better names are always welcome)

## Part 1 - Functional Linked List

For this exercise, you will be implementing an immutable linked list!

The specs are located in `1-functional-linked-list/list.spec.js`.
You will work out of `1-functional-linked-list/list.js`

There's no need to do anything like install `Immutable` - we can do this from scratch!

## Part 2 - Fullstack Version System

For this exercise, you will implement several of the basic commands in Git.
You'll create Git-like "objects" that can actually be used for version control.

The specs are located in `2-fullstack-version-system/fvs.spec.js`
You'll work out of `2-fullstack-version-system/fvs.js`

The `2-fullstack-version-system/helpers` directory contains utilities to make the command line operations work,
as well as a utility function that you'll use when you implement commit

## Part 3 - Functional

For this exercise, you will implement some fundamental functional programming utilities, including
a `curry`, `compose`, and the `Maybe Monad`!

The specs are located in `3-functional/functional.spec.js`
You will work out of `3-functional/functional.js`
